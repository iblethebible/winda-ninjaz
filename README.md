<b>I have moved to AWS and all work being completed on there now.</b>


Window Cleaning System
Database and front-end for window cleaning firm


A database which will store
Job details
  * Price
  * Location
  * Frequency
  * Date was last completed/date of next clean
  * Extra info
Customer details
  * Name
  * Contact info
  
Front end:
* Add customer/job
* Search customer/job
* Delete customer/job
* Work day page which shows which jobs need doing in certain area


What do i want to achieve?
I want a robust system to store all of the jobs and tell me when they are due to be cleaned. I want to have a front end in which i can select a certain zone in my home town and the system will tell me all of the jobs which are due to be done in that area. Also track money made on the day. 



For the database i will use MYSQL and for the front end i will use html and css. Maybe bootstrap.

I am unsure as to whether or not my system will be connected to internet or not as it would work locally on an android device. The risks of locally are that if the device breaks we lose our system. Would need constant back ups. The costs of having it connected to the internet are vast. Could use AWS maybe.

I have decided that i will push on with the local plan until i have inputted all of the customers data. From there i will likely migrate it to an AWS myswl DB utilising their 12 month free trial. I am now looking at android studio and learning to develop a simple App for the front end.
