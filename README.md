Database and front-end for window cleaning firm


A database which will store:
Job details
  -price
  -location
  -how often they want it
  -date was last completed/date of next clean
  -extra info
Customer details
  -Name
  -Contact info
  
Front end:
Add customer/job
Search customer/job
Delete customer/job
Work day page which shows which jobs need doing in certain area


What do i want to achieve?
In its basic form i want to have a front end in which i can select a certain zone in my home town and the system will tell me all of the jobs which are due to be done in that area.


For the database i will use MYSQL and for the front end i will use html and css. Maybe bootstrap.

I am unsure as to whether or not my system will be connected to internet or not as it would work locally on an android device. The risks of locally are that if the device breaks we lose our system. Would need constant back ups. The costs of having it connected to the internet are vast. Could use AWS maybe.
